## Top Priorities (Ranked)

### 1. Mobile-First Performance & Universal Access
**Core Philosophy:** Every user deserves an excellent experience regardless of their device, location, or connection speed.

The site is architected to deliver fast, smooth, and enjoyable experiences to:
- Users in remote areas with 2G/3G connections and older devices (e.g., rural Guatemala, India, Philippines)
- Users on modern devices with high-speed connections in major cities
- Everyone in between

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Minimal payload:** Lean HTML, purged CSS, minimal JavaScript
- **Progressive enhancement:** Core content and functionality work without JavaScript
- **Optimized assets:** Responsive images with multiple sizes, compressed and cached effectively
- **Fast initial render:** Critical CSS inlined, server-side rendering, no render-blocking resources
- **Resilient to poor connections:** Efficient caching, graceful degradation, service worker for offline support
- **Accessible on low-end devices:** No heavy frameworks, optimized for devices with limited CPU/RAM
- **PWA capabilities:** Installable, works offline, resilient to network failures

**Success Metric:** Site loads and is fully interactive in under 3 seconds on a 3G connection with a mid-range device from 2018.

### 2. HTML Excellence & Accessibility
**Core Philosophy:** Semantic, valid, beautiful markup that passes "view source" inspection; WCAG 2.2 AA+ compliant.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Semantic HTML5:** Proper use of landmarks, headings hierarchy, lists, tables
- **WCAG 2.2 AA+ compliance:** All interactive elements accessible via keyboard, screen reader compatible
- **Skip links:** Direct navigation to main content
- **Focus management:** Visible focus indicators, logical tab order
- **ARIA when needed:** Proper roles, states, and properties for complex interactions
- **Touch targets:** Minimum 44×44px clickable areas
- **Form accessibility:** Labels, error messages with `aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid`, error summaries
- **Forced colors mode:** CSS respects system high-contrast preferences
- **Reduced motion:** Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations

### 3. Internationalization from Day One
**Core Philosophy:** Architecture built for 13 languages (15 routes) with cultural adaptations, regional variants, and RTL support.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Complete hreflang implementation:** Every page includes proper alternate language links
- **Visible language switcher:** User-accessible UI component for changing languages
- **Culture-aware formatting:** Dates, numbers, currencies formatted per locale
- **RTL support:** Dedicated stylesheets and logical properties for Arabic and Farsi
- **Localized assets:** Images, icons, and media organized by language code
- **Resource files:** `.resx` files for all UI strings, server messages, and validation errors

### 4. Clean Developer Experience
**Core Philosophy:** Logical VS Code workflow, minimal dependencies, no frontend bloat, pure CSS3

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Zero build tools required:** Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript - edit and refresh
- **No framework bloat:** No React, Vue, Angular, or heavy dependencies
- **Modern CSS only:** CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom properties - no preprocessors needed
- **Minimal JavaScript:** Progressive enhancement approach, vanilla JS when needed
- **Version control friendly:** Plain text files, easy to diff and merge
- **Fast iteration:** No compile step, immediate feedback
- **Clear structure:** Logical file organization, semantic naming conventions
- **Well-commented code:** Self-documenting with helpful inline comments

**Recent Improvements**
- **Dazzle-Footer Effect** - Replaced static blue-to-purple linear gradient with dynamic multi-layered radial gradient effect from live ABC Translations site. Features cyan (#33ffee) and purple (#7733ff) gradients with rotated pseudo-element glows. Pure CSS implementation, +1.2 KB (+2%), ~24ms on 3G. Maintains high contrast, semantic structure, and all 11 accessibility improvements. Full details in docs/decisions.md.
- **Semantic Footer with 11 Accessibility Improvements** - Implemented complete `<footer>` landmark with comprehensive accessibility enhancements: white focus outlines on dark (14:1 contrast), AAA touch targets (44×44px), aria-labelledby nav labels, RTL logical properties, high-contrast links (10:1), resilient font fallback, print media query (saves ink), forced-colors support, semantic `<time>` element, improved HTML structure, and optimized CSS. Total: +4.4 KB (+8%), no LCP impact (below fold). Completes Priority #2.1 semantic landmark structure. Full details in docs/decisions.md.
